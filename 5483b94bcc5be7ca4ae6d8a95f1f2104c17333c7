      "message": "Don\u0027t think so. A string is still std::is_convertible to variant\u003c..., enum, string\u003e.\n\nI think the real issue here is that PIM does not really know if the incoming property is an enum in sdbusplus (should it even?)\n\nSo it cannot distinguish between a string and an enum at *compile time*. I suppose we could add sometimg to the YAML parsing to create a lookup for enum type properties and use that to make this decision (on how to properly convert it to the sdbusplus variant) at runtime.",

      "message": "\u003e So it cannot distinguish between a string and an enum at *compile time*.\n\nNothing can do this.  But why does it need to?\n\nThe sdbusplus code already has the ability to do message parsing into the variant based on the content.  If you order the variant parameters so that string is last it will always attempt conversion to the enum(s) first and then fall back to the string if the conversion is unsuccessful.\n\nI must be missing something on how PIM is using this specifically.  Doesn\u0027t it know the underlying type of the property based on the PDI class?  Doesn\u0027t it use something like `holds_alternative` to confirm the variant contains the desired type?  What is missing that explicitly needs to be known at compile time?",
